Create a 2-Player Version of Pong

Pong is one of the earliest video games, created in the early 1970â€™s by Atari. The game was immensely popular and almost single-handedly launched the video game industry. You can play a version of the game at https://www.ponggame.org. For this project you will create a 2-player version of Pong.  

Your game should adhere to the following specifications: 

- Try to make your layout of the game look as close as possible to the official version of the game.
- Control of the two paddles in the game should be through the up and down arrows for the right paddle and the S and X keys for the left paddle.
- The departure angle that the ball leaves a paddle should depend on where the center of the ball strikes the paddle. If it strikes it exactly at the center of the paddle, then it should leave at the perfect reflected angle. Otherwise, the departure angle should increase or decrease by an amount proportional to the distance from the center of the paddle. There should be a maximum and minimum angle that the departure angle must lie between.
- The movement of the ball should start out slowly and increase after every 4th strike with a paddle.  Try to ensure the ball moves at the same speed no matter the angle it leaves the paddle.
